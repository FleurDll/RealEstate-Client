# Freelance project : Real Estate

_11/05/21_

## www.ameliedufour.com

Fully responsive real estate website for a real estate agent. <br>
My client needed a showcase website to offer her services and exhibit the different homes she sells. <br>
I chose Sanity for the admin part because it's fully customizable and has instant updates. <br>
Also, my client is not familiar at all with computers. I had to make sure that she could manage the content of her website herself without difficulty. <br>
After several appointments, each request of my client was satisfied. I proposed different designs, different logos, to find what suits her best. <br>
I also wrote a pdf guide with for optimal use of the administrator part.

## Sanity Studio - Admin Part

Sanity Studio offers a fully form custimization. This is how I decided to design the schemas : <br>
Each change automatically updates the website. <br>

- Personal informations, where my client can change her phone number, email address, facebook link etc.
- Real estate catalog, creates a new real estate document with all the necessary details (title, location, rooms, price, images, description, etc...)
- A schema for each section : header, estimate, about, contact etc... Where my client is able to change the texts and images.
